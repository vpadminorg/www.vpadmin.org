The Protected Content feature, currently under development, will provide a streamlined way for you to publish your website with protected content. This feature will allow you to control who can see the full version of your articles, limiting access to preview versions for all users, with login or paid access to view the full content.</p><h2 id="vpadmin-s-stance-on-content-protection" tabindex="-1">VpAdmin&#39;s Stance on Content Protection <a class="header-anchor" href="#vpadmin-s-stance-on-content-protection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;VpAdmin&#39;s Stance on Content Protection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>VpAdmin is designed as a tool for you, the content creator. We believe that you should have control over your unique creative content. Therefore:</p><ul><li><strong>No Centralized Content Storage:</strong> VpAdmin is intentionally designed <em>not</em> to store your protected content directly, unlike other platforms. We believe that you should maintain complete control over your creative work.</li><li><strong>Empowering Creators:</strong> While it would be technically simpler for us to directly store and host your protected content, we understand that this approach is not ideal for content creators who value their intellectual property and want direct interaction with their audience.</li><li><strong>AI Era Consideration:</strong> We are keenly aware of the risks in the AI era, where creative work can be used for training AI models without the creator’s knowledge or consent. With VpAdmin, we want to give you control over where and how your creative content is accessed, helping you protect it from unauthorized use.</li></ul><h2 id="key-concepts" tabindex="-1">Key Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Concepts&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Preview Access:</strong> Users will be able to view a preview of your protected content, enticing them to gain full access.</li><li><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> You will be able to restrict access to the full content, requiring users to log in or complete a payment.</li><li><strong>User-Centric Approach</strong>: Users will be able to easily gain access to your content with simple, integrated workflows.</li></ul><video width="1080" height="768" autoplay muted loop><source src="'+r+'" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video><h2 id="future-direction" tabindex="-1">Future Direction <a class="header-anchor" href="#future-direction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Future Direction&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We are committed to providing a simple and intuitive solution to help you publish fully controlled websites with protected content.
